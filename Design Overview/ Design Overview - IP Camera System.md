## GENERAL

### Introduction
- To our knowledge there is no open-source surveillance camera that meets the outdoor requirements of Canadian winter. Therefore, a proprietary surveillance camera was selected, with an open-source integration.
- USB webcams were not considered because, as indoor products, they are not natively weatherproof, despite a similar price than low-cost surveillance cameras.

### Considerations
- The camera can only communicate with the Pi computer, it cannot communicate with the RDL.

## CAMERA

### Selection
- Among the large choice of surveillance camera, the Reolink RLC-520A was chosen for its low-cost, good quality, broad availability and its use of the standard IP protocol.

### Setup
- The Reolink camera must be setup beforehand with the Reolink software on a Windows PC. This allows giving a static IP address to the camera (required) and adjust the image (color, resolution, timestamp display, etc.)

### Operating Conditions
- The Reolink camera operation is officially limited in low temperature settings. There is no heating element inside the camera, but the electronics inside consume about 3W and release that energy as heat.

### Lens
- Note that the Reolink 520A camera has a fixed fisheye lens, which is typical of surveillance camera aiming at a large field of view.

### Capabilities
- The camera has the video capability, but currently, only images are captured by the WIRED system.

## ETHERNET SWITCH

### Connection
- The camera can be connected directly into the Pi computer (single camera system) or into the network switch (multiple cameras system).

### Switch Specifications
- The network switch is solely dedicated to being an interface between the cameras and the Pi.
- The low-cost network switch (TP-Link TL-SF1005D) chosen does not include a DHCP server. 

### Network Configuration
- In order to have two cameras on the same setup, each camera must be given a different local IP address on the network (e.g. 192.168.0.195 & 192.168.0.196)

### Independence from Internet
- The camera network is independent from the internet network. It doesnâ€™t matter if the Pi is connected to the Internet via WiFi; logging will function. The Pi RJ45 port being connected to the Ethernet card, the Ethernet port cannot be used to access internet while it is used to communicate with the camera(s); WiFi must be used.
