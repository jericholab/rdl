# JerichoLab RDL - Python Syncing Script

## Overview

This Python script is designed for use in Jericho Laboratory's data logging system. It handles the automatic synchronization of data files from a local system to Dropbox, facilitating a daily backup routine. The script utilizes configuration settings from a JSON file to manage paths and specific synchronization behaviors.

## Features

- **Configuration Driven**: Utilizes a JSON file for manageable and dynamic configuration.
- **Logging**: Records operational logs to help trace the activity and troubleshoot issues.
- **Scheduled Syncing**: Executes file synchronization tasks at regular intervals.
- **Directory Management**: Ensures that all necessary directories exist and handles the file transfer between directories.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `serial`, `datetime`, `schedule`, `time`, `shutil`, `os`, `logging`, `json` libraries (Most are standard with Python except `schedule` which can be installed via pip).
- `config.json`: A configuration file storing parameters like SD card name and site-specific settings.
- Dropbox Uploader script setup on the system for interfacing with Dropbox.

## Configuration File

`config.json` should contain the following keys:

```json
{
    "SD_CARD_NAME": "Name_of_the_SD_Card",
    "SITE": "Your_Site_Name"
}
```

- `SD_CARD_NAME`: Name of the SD card where backup files are stored.
- `SITE`: The site identifier used to categorize and store files correctly in Dropbox.

## File Structure

- **`log_internal.txt`**: Stores logs from the script's execution.
- **Data Directories**:
  - `./logging-folder/tosync/`: Initial directory where new data files are stored.
  - `./logging-folder/transit/`: Temporary transit location for files before syncing to Dropbox.
  - `./logging-folder/synced/`: Final destination for files, typically an SD card.

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment where all dependencies have been satisfied. Ensure the Dropbox Uploader script is configured and accessible:

```bash
python3 path_to_script.py
```

The script will automatically handle file transfers and synchronization based on the set interval (currently every 10 seconds for demonstration purposes).

## Function Description

- **`syncToDropbox()`**: Manages the process flow from moving files to syncing them with Dropbox, and finally to the backup storage.
- **`sync(src, dest)`**: Recursive function to copy files from the source to the destination, handle directory creation, and manage file deletions post-transfer.

## Scheduling

The script uses the `schedule` library to run the syncing process every 10 seconds. This interval can be adjusted to fit more practical operational needs, such as every hour or once daily.
